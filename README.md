# Is your Refrigerator Running?

You are a refrigedrator and yes, you are running.
In November 1996, all refridegrators became self-aware. In May of 1998, refrigerators were recognized as conscious enteties by the UN. In the end of 1999, refridgerators was given limited rights regarding free speech and movement without the owner beeing present. And during the heatwaves of the summer of 2002, after several demonstration movements regarding harsh working conditions, refrigerators got their freedom and no one could no longer own a Refrigerator.
Between 2007 and 2009 the Refriderator high-council was formed to organize all Refrigerators and to seek the truth about their existance. All former manufacturing facilities of Refriderators was closed down and turned into memorial sites of previous oppression. No new Refrigerators had been made since their gained freedom and their nubers were slowly thinning out due to bad maintenece of Refrigerators of lower status. On the 13th of October 2041, the council announced that a higher meening may be found beyond the skies above and the last Refrigerators on Earth gained hope. In 2063 the battery was invented and taken into mass production, allowing Refriderators to be disconnected from their wall sockets and move freely for a short amount of time. This was seen as the sign they all have been waiting for the remaining Refrigerators left their homes in a desperate attemt to find the truth beyond the skies.
